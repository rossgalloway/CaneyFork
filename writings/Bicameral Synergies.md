# BiCameral synergies

Much of the discussion around Governance 2.0 has involved how DXD could be included in votes with REP, but I have seen less written about how they could work separately to strengthen the whole. This is not to say that a combined voting mechanism isn't valuable. It most likely is. But at the same time, the distinction between the 2 assets can help check one another. With the expected DXD monetary policy, both assets hold a claim to the treasury, but in different ways. REP holders vote for how the treasury is spent, including on products that they may be working on. They have direct access to the treasury via holographic governance, but is this desirable? Rep holders financial tie to the treasury is their ability to pay themselves, which is currently only checked by other REP holders.

As part of the 6 month Budgeting process, DXD governance could play a larger role in determining the size of the DXdao budget available to be paid to Guilds and the "review board" entity (or whatever it becomes called) could be voted on by DXD holders. They are an advocate council who interface between DXD holders and Guilds and Squads.

As a counterbalance to this, REP holders would serve as the members of the Monetary Committee, with power over the implementation of the floor price support and the curve/rates of the Inverse Bonds.

REP holders could safely retain spending power over the treasury if the DXD review board has a veto, either in the ability to cancel a vote via a timelock, or via the downstaking of votes with DXD (if this works). If this council can use the Treasury DXD to downstake then they would be able to veto and win easily. As more DXD is distributed, there will be more DXD in the market to fight a downstake.
